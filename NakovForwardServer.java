/**
 * Nakov TCP Socket Forward Server - freeware
 * Version 1.0 - March, 2002
 * (c) 2001 by Svetlin Nakov - http://www.nakov.com
 *
 * Short decription: Nakov Forward Server is designed to forward (redirect) TCP
 * connections from a client to a server choosen from a servers list. When a client
 * is connected to Nakov Forward Server, a new connection is opened to some of the
 * specified destination servers and all the traffic from destination server to
 * Nakov Forward Server is redirected to the client and also all the traffic from
 * the client to Nakov Forward Server is redirected to destination server. That
 * way Nakov Forward Server makes transparent redirection of TCP connections.
 * The data transfer schema is the following:
 *
 *     CLIENT <--> NAKOV_FORWARD_SERVER <--> DESTINATION_SERVER
 *
 * Clients and Destination Servers communicate only with Nakov Forward Server.
 *
 * Nakov Forward Server supports failt tolerance. When some of the servers in the
 * list fail to respond to TCP connect request (dead server), Nakov Forward Server
 * tries the next server in the list until it finds alive server. All dead servers
 * are checked if they are alive through some time interval and when some server
 * becomes available, it is added to alive list. When no server is alive, no
 * connection will be established.
 *
 * Nakov Forward Server supports also load balancing features. If load balancing
 * is enabled, when a client connection is accepted, Nakov Forward Server will
 * redirect the client to the least loaded server from the servers list. We consider
 * the server which hast minimal alive connections established by Nakov Forward
 * Server is least loaded.
 *
 * What we gain when we use Nakov Proxy Server?
 *     - Destination server does not know the real IP of the client. It thinks
 * that the IP of Nakov Forward Server is its client. Thus we can use a server
 * licensed for one IP address on several machines simultaneously.
 *     - Nakov Forward Server can run on a port number that is allowed by the
 * firewall and forward to a port number that is not allowed by firewall. Thus,
 * started on a server in a local network, it can give access to some disabled
 * by the firewall services.
 *     - Nakov Forward Server can give access to multiple clients to some service
 * that is allowed only for some fixed IP address when started on the machine
 * with this IP.
 *     - Fault Tolerance (failover) of Nakov Forward Server helps to avoid faults
 * when some of the servers die. Of course there is special hardware for this, but
 * it has high price. Instead you can use Nakov Forward Server (that is free).
 * If you setup several Nakov Forward Servers configured to use the same set of
 * destination servers and if you configure your routers to use redirect traffic
 * to both servers, you will obtain a stable fault tolerance system. In such a
 * system you have guarantee that crash of any of the servers (including some of
 * the Nakov Forward Servers) will not stop the service that these servers provide.
 * Of course the destination servers should run in a cluster and replicate their
 * sessions.
 *     - Load balancing helps to avoid overloading of the servers by distributing
 * the clients between them. Of course this should be done by special hardware
 * called "load balancer", but if we don't have such hardware, we can still use
 * this technology. When we use load balancing, all the servers in the list should
 * be running in a cluster and there should be no matter what of the servers the
 * client is connected to. The servers should communicate each other and replicate
 * their session data.
 *
 * NakovForwardServer.properties configuration file contains all the settings of
 * Nakov Forward Server. The only mandatory field is "Servers"
 * Destination servers should be in following format:
 *     Servers = server1:port1, server2:port2, server3:port3, ...
 * For example:
 *     Servers = 192.168.0.22:80, rakiya:80, 192.168.0.23:80, www.nakov.com:80
 * Nakov Forward Server listening port should be in format:
 *     ListeningPort = some_port (in range 1-65535)
 * Using load balancing algorithm is specified by following line:
 *     LoadBalancing = Yes/No
 * Check alive interval through which all dead threads should be re-checked if
 * they are alive is specified by following line:
 *     CheckAliveInterval = time_interval (in milliseconds)
